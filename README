PullToRefreshView

It is:
 - a pull-to-refresh implementation
 - very easy to implement
 - doesn't suck
 - Supports ARC and Non-ARC
 - Add to bottom or top
 

To implement it:

Setup:
 - add the five files (PullToRefreshView.{h,m}, ARCMacros.h, arrow.png and arrow@2x.png) to your project
 - add the Quartz framework to your project if you haven't done so yet
 - add QuartzCore to your project

in your .h:
 - add #import "PullToRefreshView.h"
 - add the instance variable: PullToRefreshView *pull;

in your .m:
 - add the following to loadView or viewDidLoad (and be sure to release in dealloc/viewDidUnload, etc):
    pull = [[PullToRefreshView alloc] initWithScrollView:<your scroll view here>];
    [pull setDelegate:self];
    [<your scroll view here> addSubview:pull];
 - in dealloc and viewDidUnload, add calls to:
    [pull containingViewDidUnload];
 - implement two delegate methods:
    - (void)pullToRefreshViewShouldRefresh:(PullToRefreshView *)view; // required 
    - (NSDate *)pullToRefreshViewLastUpdated:(PullToRefreshView *)view; // optional
 - In pullToRefreshViewShouldRefresh: call the following when you have finished loading (or hit an error):
    [pull finishedLoading];
